# FRUIT AND NUT PROJECT

The custom module called Overview list displays a Crop and Cultivars, allowing data to be displayed  "dynamically". You can expand the symbol "+" to see more details from each crop and cultivar.

Examples: [image one](/ScreenShot.png) and [image two](/ScreenShot2.png)

## Getting Started

Before you install this custom module you need to install another custom module called mlfruitandnut. Please find more information in my github custom module mlfruitandnut.
After you install that module you will be able to install this module Overview.


### Prerequisites

- Drupal 8.6.x
- PHP 7.1.x
- Custom module mlfruitandnut (D8)
- MySQL or  PostgreSQL
- CSV Import Module [CSV Import](https://www.drupal.org/project/csv_importer) - Downloads 8.x.1.4

### Installing

To install this custom module you just need to copy the module into your Drupal 8 Module folder or custom folder. After that go to my Drupal 8 Extend to install the module.

This custom module works with a content type form already created by a second custom module called mlfruitandnut. This custom module installs and sets up the content type form based on data already inserted by a second module.

## Running the tests

To run a test you need to install the mlfruitandnut module. Next, add data into your content type form. Then you can search on your domainname.com/mainlab_list to see your Overview data.
